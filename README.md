## Interesting technology
 ### matheclipse
 > symja-2015-09-26.jar
- Use to calculate number in string like ``eval()`` in Javascript.

### kryonet
> kryonet-2.21-all.jar

- Make game server.

### mysql server
> mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar

- Connect game to database.

## Design Pattern

 Strategy => Calculadola in each calculate style

 Singleton => In Account class

 Oberserver => In all extends Task class
